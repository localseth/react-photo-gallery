# Photo Gallery App
A simple photo gallery and search app that generates the first 24 flickr images related to a specified tag. This project was written developed using React.

## Code Features
### `ImageLoader`
The `ImageLoader` component is the central brain of the app's interface. This component handles all the GET requests and passes them into the state of the component to be utilized and passed into the `Grid` component for displaying the images. `ImageLoader` also handles the logic for displaying images based either on a search query entered by the user or from a list of pre-assigned tags that are fetched when the page first loads.

### `defaultList`
This is an array which defines the pre-assigned tags that will be fetched when the page loads. The array items can be changed and the buttons and GET requests will follow suit. It is currently built to only work with 3 pre-assigned categories.

### `Loading`
This component is a simple loading animation that blurs the background while images are being fetched. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-loading-spinner-with-css.html) and modified to fit my needs.

### Miscellaneous
There are many other features of React and JavaScript that I used for this project that were new to me. Create React App saved me tons of time, React Router is very intelligent, and the good old-fashioned "phone a friend" came in handy.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
